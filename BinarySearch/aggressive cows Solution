Solution to Aggressive Cows : 

1. Let us take a random x which tells that the distance between consecutive cows should atleast be x

   If we CANT place all the k cows in the stalls such that distance between consecutive cows is x ,
   
   -- We cant place cows with distance >= x 
   -- and we ONLY have to see if it is possible for number < x
   
   If we CAN place k cows in the stalls such that distance between consecutive cows is x , 
   
   -- We can place cows with distance < x but as we have to maximize our answer , there is no point in choosing them
   -- We may place cows with distance > x 
   
2. Do a binary search which searches the ANSWER 

low = 0 , high = 10^9

Check if it is possible to place cows with distance between any two cows atleast mid = (low+high)/2

  -- If we cannot place , then there is no point in searching for values from mid to high , therefore high = mid , do binary search again
  -- If we can place , then we can simply search for values from mid + 1 to high , therefore make low = mid+1 , do binary search again
  
This will make sure we have the maximum answer 

This is binary searching the answer
